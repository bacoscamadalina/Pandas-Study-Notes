# Pandas Study Notes

Welcome to my **Pandas Study Notes** repository! This project contains the scripts and data files I used while learning the Pandas library for data analysis in Python. 

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey with Pandas. I create different Python files to explore various functionalities of Pandas.

I used resources from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) to guide my learning process, where I found tutorials, datasets, and examples that were extremely helpful. The included `.csv` file was sourced from the internet and serves as an example for practicing data loading, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas.

1. **CreatingReadingWriting.py**  
   This script focuses on the basics of Pandas, including how to create data structures (Series and DataFrames), read data from CSV, and write data back to files. It's an introductory file to get familiar with Pandas’ core functionality.

2. **IndexingSelectingAssigning.py**  
   This script covers how to index, select, and assign values to a DataFrame. It explores various ways to access specific rows, columns, and subsets of the data, as well as modifying data within the DataFrame.

3. **SummaryFunctionsandMaps.py**  
   This script dives into using Pandas’ built-in summary functions like `mean`, `map`, `count`, etc. It also demonstrates how to apply functions to DataFrames, use mapping, and other advanced data transformation techniques.

4. **economic-survey-of-manufacturing-june-2024-csv.csv**  
   This CSV file contains data used in the scripts for practice.

5. **requirements.txt**  
   The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python libraries and versions required to run the scripts in this repository.
